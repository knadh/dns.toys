- id: 60
  text_en: "Management insisted we wouldn't need to waste our time writing unit tests."
- id: 61
  text_en: "Maybe somebody forgot to pay our hosting company."
- id: 62
  text_en: "My time was split in a way that meant I couldn't do either project properly."

  text_en: "That wasn't in the original specification."
- id: 86
  text_en: "That worked perfectly when I developed it."
- id: 87
  text_en: "That wouldn't be economically feasible."
- id: 88
  text_en: "That's already fixed, it just hasn't taken effect yet."
- id: 89
  text_en: "That's interesting, how did you manage to make it do that?"
- id: 90
  text_en: "That's not a bug it's a configuration issue."
- id: 91
  text_en: "That's the fault of the graphic designer."
- id: 92
  text_en: "The accounting department must have canceled that subscription."

  text_en: "The specifications were ambiguous."
- id: 107
  text_en: "The third-party documentation doesn't exist."
- id: 108
  text_en: "The user must not know how to use it."
- id: 109
  text_en: "There must be something strange in your data."
- id: 110
  text_en: "There was too little data to bother with the extra functionality at the time."
- id: 111
  text_en: "There's currently a problem with our hosting company."
- id: 112
  text_en: "This code was not supposed to go into production yet."
- id: 113
  text_en: "This is a previously known bug you told me not to work on yet."
- id: 114
  text_en: "We didn't have enough time to peer review the final changes."

  text_en: "Well done, you found my easter egg!"
- id: 116
  text_en: "Well, at least it displays a very pretty error."
- id: 117
  text_en: "Well, at least we know not to try that again."
- id: 118
  text_en: "Well, that's a first."
- id: 119
  text_en: "What did I tell you about using parts of the system you don't understand?"
- id: 120
  text_en: "What did you type in wrong to get it to crash?"
- id: 121
  text_en: "Where were you when the program blew up?"
- id: 122
  text_en: "Why do you want to do it that way?"
- id: 123
  text_en: "You must have done something wrong."
- id: 124
  text_en: "You're doing it wrong."
- id: 125
  text_en: "You must have the wrong version."
- id: 126
  text_en: "You used the wrong compiling options in the build I made."
- id: 127
  text_en: "I got pulled into another project that needed to be done urgently."

  text_en: "Are you sure you want it to work that way?"
- id: 130
  text_en: "Are you sure you've installed the latest patches to your browser?"
- id: 131
  text_en: "Are you sure you've installed the latest patches to your operating system?"
- id: 132
  text_en: "Are you sure?"
- id: 133
  text_en: "But we're a small team so what do you expect?"
- id: 134
  text_en: "But we're a startup so what do you expect?"
- id: 135
  text_en: "But we're underresourced so what do you expect?"
- id: 136
  text_en: "Everyone was sick."
- id: 137
  text_en: "Have you cleared your cache?"
- id: 138
  text_en: "Have you tried refreshing your browser?"
- id: 139
  text_en: "Have you updated your browser?"
- id: 140
  text_en: "Have you updated your OS?"
- id: 141
  text_en: "I couldn't reproduce that error."
- id: 142
  text_en: "I did a quick fix for that already, it must have been reverted."
- id: 143
  text_en: "I don't remember that in the original specification."
- id: 144
  text_en: "I don't see anything in my error logs."
- id: 145
  text_en: "I forgot my computer."
- id: 146
  text_en: "I found a bug in the Framework."

  text_en: "I had too many projects so I had to rush that feature."
- id: 148
  text_en: "I haven't pushed the fix up yet."
- id: 149
  text_en: "I just need one more day to work on that."
- id: 150
  text_en: "I never received a ticket for that."
- id: 151
  text_en: "I thought that was signed off?"
- id: 152
  text_en: "I was busy fixing more important issues."
- id: 153
  text_en: "I was sick."
- id: 154
  text_en: "I was sure that had been fixed."
- id: 155
  text_en: "I wasn't told how to do that so I had to guess which way the clients wanted it."
- id: 156
  text_en: "I'm pretty sure that works most of the time."
- id: 157
  text_en: "I'm pretty sure that's the way it is meant to work."
- id: 158
  text_en: "I'm still working on that part of the codebase."
- id: 159
  text_en: "I'm sure that was written by a contractor."
- id: 160
  text_en: "I'm sure that was written by a freelancer."
- id: 161
  text_en: "Is that not supposed to happen?"
- id: 162
  text_en: "It must be a browser cache error."

  text_en: "It must be an issue with the corporate firewall."
- id: 167
  text_en: "It must be missing some dependencies."
- id: 168
  text_en: "It must be the corporate proxy."
- id: 169
  text_en: "It was only a small change so I didn't think it needed tests."
- id: 170
  text_en: "It was probably a race condition."
- id: 171
  text_en: "It's a browser issue."
- id: 172
  text_en: "It's just a warning, not an error."
- id: 173
  text_en: "It's most likely a forwarding proxy server that is caching the response."
- id: 174
  text_en: "It's not like I can't write that fix in like 5 minutes."
- id: 175
  text_en: "No, I didn't get any email from you about that."
- id: 176
  text_en: "Nothing has changed in the code."
- id: 177
  text_en: "Oh, that was only supposed to be a placeholder."
- id: 178
  text_en: "Oh, you said you DIDN'T want that to happen?"
- id: 179
  text_en: "Our code quality is up to industry standards."
- id: 180
  text_en: "PEBKAC."
- id: 181
  text_en: "Someone must have changed my code."
- id: 182
  text_en: "That code was written by the last dev."
- id: 183
  text_en: "That code wasn't meant to be in production."
- id: 184
  text_en: "That error means it was successful."
- id: 185
  text_en: "That feature is a nice-to-have."
- id: 186
  text_en: "That feature is low priority."
- id: 187
  text_en: "That feature is on our roadmap."
- id: 188
  text_en: "That feature isn't due in this phase."
- id: 189
  text_en: "That feature isn't due yet."
- id: 190
  text_en: "That output is only wrong 99% of the time."
- id: 191
  text_en: "That output is only wrong half the time."
- id: 192
  text_en: "That was like that before I started here."
- id: 193
  text_en: "That's a data model issue."
- id: 194
  text_en: "That's a problem with a third-party application."
- id: 195
  text_en: "That's a training issue."
- id: 196
  text_en: "That's a user issue."
- id: 197
  text_en: "That's a vendor issue."

  text_en: "The design makes it difficult to build this correctly."

  text_en: "The documentation for that feature is wrong."
- id: 203
  text_en: "The failovers must have failed."
- id: 204
  text_en: "The file must have been corrupted."
- id: 205
  text_en: "The fix for that is in progress."
- id: 206
  text_en: "The issue tracker was updated and some issues were lost."
- id: 207
  text_en: "The program was never meant to work that way."
- id: 208
  text_en: "The specification contained conflicting requirements."
- id: 209
  text_en: "The stakeholder was sick."
- id: 210
  text_en: "The tests didn't cover that edge case."
- id: 211
  text_en: "There must be a problem with the virtual machine."
- id: 212
  text_en: "There must have been a miscommunication during the requirements phase."
- id: 213
  text_en: "There must have been a problem with the request."

  text_en: "This is the first time anyone has mentioned it."
- id: 216
  text_en: "This wasn't filed in the issue tracker."
- id: 217
  text_en: "We broke that deliberately to test it."
- id: 218
  text_en: "We contracted that work out months ago."
- id: 219
  text_en: "We didn't have the budget to build it properly."
- id: 220
  text_en: "We didn't have time to QA that feature."
- id: 221
  text_en: "We don't have the bandwidth to address that at the moment."
- id: 222
  text_en: "We don't have the budget to address that at the moment."
- id: 223
  text_en: "We have to do it that way for security reasons."
- id: 224
  text_en: "We must have been stress testing the server."
- id: 225
  text_en: "We outsourced that part."
- id: 226
  text_en: "We were never asked to make it do that."
- id: 227
  text_en: "We've not been able to reproduce the problem."

  text_en: "That must be a sales department error."
- id: 237
  text_en: "Man, I am not that type of a person!"
- id: 238
  text_en: "Someone must have left some test code in."
- id: 239
  text_en: "The client requested an XML response, but JSON is clearly better."
- id: 240
  text_en: "The dev that worked here for a week? Yeah, he wrote that."
